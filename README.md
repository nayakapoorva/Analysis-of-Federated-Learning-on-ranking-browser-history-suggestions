## Introduction
+ Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. In this current age computing is getting larger amount of information, this information contains private data. ML uses centralized locations to store such private data  which has high chances of compromising user security. To avoid this issues there are many techniques one of them is Federated Learning. Federated Learning, a new technique that allows training models on data which only exists on user devices.

## Components : 
+ `Data` - Functions for loading or generating datasets.
## Tools Required: 
+ Ananconda(Jupyter Notebook)
